3 Which we drink on a bench outside in the heat, watching logging trucks go by 




Pulled off at the Three Sisters Overlook on the McKenzie Pass, Oregon 
1 The peak ashen and burnt and raven filled, like some ungodly place

Prineville Coffee Company, Prineville, OR

3 That's a bobolink, he says. A bobolink!

On the front porch of Liâ€™s Chinese restaurant in Council, Idaho 
1 When we walk in the chef, a man with a buzz cut and a torn plastic camo jacket, runs to the back and turns on a multicolored boombox and begins dancing wildly, Gangnam style 
2 There is no menu, he says. The menu is in his head. 
3 We toast each other with slices of watermelon that arrive inexplicably and he says, my children have gone home to Shanghai, it is hard to own a restaurant here, I have not heard anyone speak Chinese for years 




On the back of a truck headed to Riggins, Idaho 
1 I worry about you kids, says the old man who approaches us outside of a cafe where we have only ordered chicken soup and coffee. The canyon pass gets nasty and narrow.

3 But the lady can sit on the ice chest if its more comfortable.
